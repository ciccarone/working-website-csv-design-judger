# Website Critiquer

This Python script is designed to automate the process of capturing screenshots of websites, encoding the images into base64 format, and then using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model to analyze the images and provide professional feedback to the designer.

## Code Breakdown

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries:** The script begins by importing necessary Python libraries such as `subprocess`, `os`, `base64`, `time`, `errno`, `pandas`, and `selenium.webdriver`.

2. **OpenAI Client Initialization:** The OpenAI client is initialized with `client = OpenAI()`.

3. **Function `encode_image(image_path)`:** This function takes an image path as input, opens the image file in read-binary mode, and returns the base64 encoding of the image. If the file cannot be opened due to an `IOError`, the function will wait for 0.1 seconds and then try again.

4. **Function `generate_new_line(base64_image)`:** This function takes a base64 encoded image as input and returns a list containing a dictionary. The dictionary represents a new line for the conversation with the OpenAI model. The role is set to "user", and the content is a list containing a text prompt for the model and the base64 encoded image.

The script is designed to be used in conjunction with a larger script that reads URLs from a CSV file, uses Selenium WebDriver to navigate to each URL and capture a screenshot, and then uses the OpenAI model to analyze the screenshot and provide feedback. The feedback is then stored back into the CSV file.
